# DInvoke_shellcodeload_CSharp



Blog link: May not gonna update.

* A ShellcodeLoader base on my another project(https://github.com/Kara-4search/Simple_ShellCodeLoader_CSharp), inspire by TheWover(https://github.com/TheWover).
* The purpose is to bypass EDR 's APIs hook, or danger APIs dectection.
* Use D/Invoke to load shellcode into memory.
* **I removed a lot of unnecessary code from the original project, make the code easy for understanding.**
* You could change the function name or do other magic works make it better for EDR bypassing.
* I only tested it on x86 with the shellcode below(It is a calc shellcode), but it should be able to work on x64.

  ```c#
  byte[] codepent = new byte[193] {

* You could use API monitor(http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor) to test the project, comparing with the SimpleLoader(https://github.com/Kara-4search/Simple_ShellCodeLoader_CSharp), You could see there is no API call via D/Invoke.



## Usage

1. Just replace the shellcode.
2. Launch it through some white list applications


## Comparing via API monitor

There are mainly 3 APIs we are gonna monitor:

* VirtualAlloc
* CreateThread
* WaitForSingleObject

  
1. You could see the picture below, the SimpleLoader' s API call caught by API monitor.

2. And the **DInvoke ShellcodeLoader**'s API call was not caught by API monitor.
